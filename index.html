            Hello,
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m <strong>Fabien, frontend developer, ascendant architect</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The latter gives me a better understanding at how interface and people can work, the former allows me to make these a reality.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            As a <em>Frontend developer</em>, I’ve always pushed for Web Standards, resource optimization and fluid designs. I continue now with Responsive Web Design and like to fiddle with SVG.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a <em>former architect</em>, I also have a sense for graphics and structure, and a fair understanding of how human interact with objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a <em>traveller</em>, I like the idea of working remotely, be it close to the office, or out in the wild.

Being part of this team for 10 years has been awesome and set the path I am still following to this day.

Helping speakers before, during and after the event was one of the most rewarding experiences ever. It was also a nice introduction to working remotely, with people in France, New‑Caledonia and China.

                    2012~2014: (<abbr>NSFW</abbr>) On <a href="http://kaufmich.com/">http://kaufmich.com/</a>, my biggest challenge was to clean legacy code while adding more features to the website. Considering the amount of people and code added through the years, it was <i>quite some fun</i>!

                    Using grunt, sass and a PHP version of <a href="http://warpspire.com/kss/"><abbr title="Knyle Style Sheets">KSS</abbr></a>, I started the HTML &amp; CSS integration of a <a href="http://www.kaufmich.com/m/user/register">mobile first version</a> based on <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr> before I left in September. This was the first stone of multiple goals:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To revamp the whole website by gradually moving the desktop features to a <abbr>RWD</abbr> version presented as the mobile version, then switching the desktop to the <abbr>RWD</abbr> website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To improve collaboration between graphic designer, marketing, support and development teams by providing live style‑guides for reference.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I mainly worked on the <em>administrative side of the application</em>. We’ve started the process for a <em>global redesign of <a href="http://www.juwai.com">www.juwai.com</a></em> on December 2015. This should bring us closer to today’s standards in term of interface and interaction.
