            Hello,
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m <strong>Fabien, frontend developer, former architect</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The latter gives me a better understanding at how interface and people can work, the former allows me to make these a reality.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            As a <em>Frontend developer</em>, I’ve always pushed for Web Standards, resource optimization and fluid designs. I continue now with Responsive Web Design and like to fiddle with SVG.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a <em>former architect</em>, I also have a sense for graphics and structure, and a fair understanding of how people interact with objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a <em>traveller</em>, I like the idea of working remotely, be it close to the office, or out in the wild.

                    2012~2014: (<abbr>NSFW</abbr>) On <a href="http://kaufmich.com/">http://kaufmich.com/</a>, my biggest challenge was to clean legacy code while adding more features to the website. Considering the amount of people and code added through the years, it was <i>quite some fun</i>!

                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To improve collaboration between graphic designer, marketing, support and development teams by providing live style‑guides for reference.

                    I mainly worked on the <em>administrative side of the application</em>. We’ve started the process for a <em>global redesign of <a href="http://www.juwai.com">www.juwai.com</a></em> on December 2015. This should bring us closer to today’s standards in term of interface and interaction.
